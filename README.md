This study compares time-series anomaly detection methods using rule-based approaches, including quantile methods, Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviation (GESD), and quantile regression, with unsupervised techniques such as Isolation Forest and One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM). To enhance forecast reliability, conformal forecasting is applied to provide statistically valid confidence measures for detected anomalies.
